# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://bit.ly/3TkuCh3) uses [Babel](https://bit.ly/3TkuCh3) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://bit.ly/3TkuCh3) uses [SWC](https://bit.ly/3TkuCh3)) for Fast Refresh
